# Calmo üëå

A functional app that uses the VR experience to reduce anxiety and pain during procedures.

### How to use Calmo

You will need:

* A smartphone
* A viewer (eg: [these viewers](https://vr.google.com/intl/en_uk/cardboard/get-cardboard/))

Then download the Calmo app on your phone for free at the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

### The Problem

Having blood taken can be an experience filled with anxiety and pain. The thought of this procedure can put people off having this simple procedure, which in turn can potentially lead to a delay or cancellation in treatments, affecting the patient's health outcomes and an inefficient use of clinicians' time.

Studies show between 3.5-10% of people have needle phobia.

The accessibility of VR technology introduces a new avenue of procedural distraction through VR.

### User stories

#### As a user...

* I want to be able to complete a blood collection procedure with minimal pain and anxiety.
* I want to be able to use the app despite language barriers and/or learning difficulties

#### As a clinician...

* I want to be able to easily extract blood from the patient inflicting minimal pain and anxiety.
* I want to extract blood from the patient within an average timeframe of 5mins

### How We Built It

#### The design

* Development of user stories
* Conducting secondary research
* Carrying out user testing & interviews

#### The build

This app was built with:

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/virtual-reality)
* The target platform using [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/)
* Audio track created in Logic Pro

### Considerations

* Translations
* Learning Difficulties
* Infection Control
* Users with impairments such as hearing
* Patients having procedures in a variety of positions (ie: supine, prone, sidelying, sitting)
* Patients who have epilepsy / nausea
* Safety case and testing of the app

### Future Features

* A variety of environments, such as a forest, mountains or a beach setting.
* Scaling for patients of all ages (for example use for paediatrics, adolescents, adults and geriatrics)
